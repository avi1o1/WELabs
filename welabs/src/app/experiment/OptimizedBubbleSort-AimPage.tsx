          <li>Understand the limitations of the standard Bubble Sort algorithm</li>
          <li>Identify situations where the basic Bubble Sort is inefficient</li>
          <li>Implement the optimized version of Bubble Sort that includes early termination</li>
          <li>Recognize how small changes to algorithms can lead to significant performance improvements</li>
          <li>Compare the performance of optimized Bubble Sort with the standard implementation</li>
        </ul>

          The optimized version of Bubble Sort addresses some of the inefficiencies of the standard algorithm, making it more practical for certain use cases while still maintaining the conceptual simplicity that makes Bubble Sort valuable as a learning tool.
