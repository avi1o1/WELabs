      question: "What are Virtual Labs?",
      answer: (

          <p className="mb-4">
            Virtual Labs are intended to augment the learning of science and engineering subjects through 
            performing experiments. The experiments are designed either as simulations or as remote triggered. 
            A remote triggered lab allows a user to connect to real equipment using a web browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are currently around 150 labs and 1500 experiments at various stages of development and 
            deployment. They are currently hosted at Vlabs. Virtual Labs is an initiative of Ministry of 
            Human Resources, India.

            <li>To provide remote access to Labs in various disciplines.</li>

            There are two types of Virtual Labs:

          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Simulation Based Virtual Labs:</strong> In these Virtual Labs, the experiments are 
              modeled using mathematical equations. The simulations are carried out remotely at a high end 
              server, and the results are communicated to the student over the internet. This class of 
              Virtual Labs, at best, mimics the real-world scenarios/experiments. Simulation based Virtual 
              Labs are scalable and can cater to a large number of simultaneous users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Remote Triggered Virtual Labs:</strong> In these Virtual Labs, the actual experiments 
              are triggered remotely. The output of the experiment (being conducted remotely) is communicated 
              back to the student over the internet. This class of Virtual Labs, gives the student the output 
              of real-time experiments. Remote Triggered Virtual Labs are difficult to scale and can cater to 
              a limited number of users. Typically, time-slots are booked before conducting such experiments.

          available at a common place. Virtual Labs can be used in a complementary fashion to augment the efficacy 
          of theory-based lectures. Small projects can also be carried out using some of the Virtual Labs. 
          Virtual Labs can be effectively used to give lab-demonstrations to large classes.
